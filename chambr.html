            <h2>New Zealand</h2>
            <p>New Zealand is an island country lying in the southwest of the Pacific Ocean and is popularly known for its staggering beauty, rich culture, and biodiversity. Composed of two landmasses-the North Island and the South Island-it has combined the best of the breathtaking natural splendor from emerald hills to towering mountains, stunning beaches, and pulsating cities. Among these more standard tourist attractions, thermal wonders like Rotorua, spectacular fjords such as Milford Sound, and beautiful landscapes that served as the background for the shooting of the well-known film epic "Lord of the Rings" are included.</p>

            <p> Besides all the natural beauty, New Zealand is able to offer a lot from the rich Maori culture: ample opportunities to come into contact with indigenous traditions-to try real local food. From adventure through to utter relaxation, and on to the cultural enrichment of capricious whims for every single traveler, New Zealand will surely create those moments-just one of those no person touring the wonders of the world should miss.</p>

            <h2>Native animal</h2>
            <p>The Kiwi is one of New Zealand's most iconic native species and one of the nation's symbols. These small, flightless birds with their long beak, fluffy brown feathers, and a habits of walking at night have their natural habitats here. Although small in size, the Kiwi is significant enough to be considered part of New Zealand's cultural heritage; New Zealanders call themselves "Kiwis." The Kiwi is a very weird bird that has nostrils at the end of its long beak, helping to locate insects and other small invertebrates in the ground. The Kiwi is threatened not only by habitat destruction but also by predation from introduced animals. Because of this, numerous nature reserves and sanctuaries were allowed to be set aside around the country, with their ultimate goal being the protection of this dear bird. Meanwhile, for visitors to New Zealand, there may frequently be an opportunity to see Kiwi in such sanctuaries or hear about ongoing conservation projects by visiting local wildlife centers.</p>

            <h2>Culture and Diversity</h2>
            <p>New Zealand is alive with a rich cultural mix of Maori heritage and the influence of its European settlers. The culture of New Zealand has a deep root with the Maori, wherein traditional customs include the haka-or war dance-which to this very day can force a lump in the throat as a means of pride and unity. Te Reo is an official language, and place names throughout the country reflect this heritage. New Zealanders are friendly and easy-going- more affectionately known as "Kiwis." Festivals, art, music, and food show the cultural diversity of the country, making it a very friendly country to its tourists. To learn more about Maori culture, visit a cultural center such as Te Puia in Rotorua or stop at a Marae and enjoy a traditional welcome ceremony.
