            <h2>Native animal</h2>
            <p>The Kiwi is one of New Zealand's most iconic native species and one of the nation's symbols. These small, flightless birds with their long beak, fluffy brown feathers, and a habits of walking at night have their natural habitats here. Although small in size, the Kiwi is significant enough to be considered part of New Zealand's cultural heritage; New Zealanders call themselves "Kiwis." The Kiwi is a very weird bird that has nostrils at the end of its long beak, helping to locate insects and other small invertebrates in the ground. The Kiwi is threatened not only by habitat destruction but also by predation from introduced animals. Because of this, numerous nature reserves and sanctuaries were allowed to be set aside around the country, with their ultimate goal being the protection of this dear bird. Meanwhile, for visitors to New Zealand, there may frequently be an opportunity to see Kiwi in such sanctuaries or hear about ongoing conservation projects by visiting local wildlife centers.</p>
